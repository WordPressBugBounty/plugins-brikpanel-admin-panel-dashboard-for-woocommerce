/**
 * BrikPanel: BrikControl check for bot traffic left in the analytics tables.
 *
 * Every storefront counter BrikPanel keeps has, at some point, been inflated by
 * scripted traffic before its server-side cap existed: add-to-cart and
 * checkout until 3.3.1, daily visitors, product views, page views, traffic
 * sources and device counts until 3.3.11, and the abandoned-cart capture
 * endpoint until 3.3.2. The counters are fixed. The rows they already wrote
 * are not, and they are what the dashboard reads: one store with under a
 * hundred real visitors a day showed eleven thousand.
 *
 * This check looks at all of it in one place and cleans all of it with one
 * button. Two rules decide what is wrong, kept apart because they carry very
 * different certainty:
 *
 *   Impossible: a visit precedes an add-to-cart, so a day where the store's
 *   add-to-carts (or one product's) outnumber its visitors is arithmetic, not
 *   a judgement call. Capping to the visitor figure is the correction.
 *
 *   Extreme: a day many times the series' own normal, and large in absolute
 *   terms. A heuristic that can in principle catch a real promotion, which is
 *   why nothing is written before the merchant looks at the list and confirms.
 *
 *   Certain: an abandoned-cart entry written by a script, by the rules of the
 *   "Abandoned Cart Entries" check (a browser id this plugin never issued, one
 *   id typing many addresses within minutes, one address from many ids within
 *   minutes, bursts of empty checkout signups). Only the certain tier is
 *   deleted; the "likely" tier stays reported.
 *
 * Nothing is lost. A flagged day is lowered to the highest value it could
 * honestly have had (never zero: that would be as wrong as the inflated
 * figure), a flagged entry is copied whole before it is deleted, and every
 * previous value is kept in a restore point that one click replays. The
 * restore point never expires on its own; the merchant decides when it goes.
 *
 * @package BrikPanel
 * @since   3.3.11
